# We're the Open Source Software Foundation.
We believe that by making software open-source and free to use, we can democratize access to technology and promote innovation. Our foundation is committed to extending this mission to as many people and organizations as possible, so that everyone can benefit from the power of software. We are constantly working to expand our reach and impact, and we welcome anyone who shares our vision to join us in this important work.
